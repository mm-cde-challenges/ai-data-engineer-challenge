# mama health — AI Data Engineer Challenge

## Mapping the Treatment Evidence Landscape from Biomedical Literature

## Background

At mama health, we build conversational AI systems that guide patients through complex healthcare journeys. Our platform depends on a deep understanding of the treatment landscape — which therapies exist for a given condition, what outcomes they produce, how the evidence base has evolved, and where gaps remain.

PubMed is the world's largest repository of biomedical literature, containing over 36 million citations with abstracts, structured metadata (MeSH terms, author affiliations, grant information), and publication history. When ingested and analyzed systematically, this data can surface the arc of treatment research for any chronic condition — from early case reports through large-scale RCTs, revealing paradigm shifts, emerging therapies, and under-studied populations.

We are looking for an engineer who can build a **reproducible, well-orchestrated data pipeline** that ingests PubMed abstracts, extracts structured treatment-evidence data from them, and produces analytics that combine LLM-powered text extraction with rich bibliographic metadata.

## Your Mission

Build an **end-to-end data pipeline** using **Dagster** that ingests abstracts from the PubMed bulk download for a chronic condition of your choosing (e.g., Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 2 diabetes, endometriosis), then processes this data to map the treatment evidence landscape.

The system should demonstrate:

1. **Infrastructure discipline** — a fully reproducible environment using Docker Compose, `uv`, and `pyproject.toml`
2. **Pipeline orchestration** — clean Dagster assets/jobs that are observable and restartable
3. **LLM-powered extraction** — using Gemini to turn dense biomedical abstracts into structured treatment-evidence data
4. **Analytical thinking** — meaningful post-processing that combines extracted insights with PubMed's rich metadata

---

## Core Tasks

### 1. Environment & Infrastructure Setup

Set up a reproducible development environment with:

- **`pyproject.toml`** as the single source of truth for dependencies (no `requirements.txt`)
- **`uv`** as the package manager (lockfile committed)
- **`docker-compose.yml`** that starts the full Dagster stack (webserver, daemon, user code) plus a PostgreSQL instance
- The entire system must start with a single `docker compose up` and be immediately functional
- Include a `.env.example` with all required environment variables documented

**We value reproducibility above all else here.** A reviewer should be able to clone your repository, copy `.env.example` to `.env`, fill in their credentials, and have the pipeline running within minutes.

### 2. PubMed Data Ingestion

Build a Dagster job (or set of software-defined assets) that ingests abstracts from the PubMed bulk download:

- **Data source:** The PubMed annual baseline, distributed as gzip-compressed XML files on the NLM FTP server at https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/baseline/. Files follow the naming convention `pubmed25nXXXX.xml.gz`, where `XXXX` is a sequential number. Each file contains approximately 30,000 citation records. **Higher-numbered files contain more recently added records** — start downloading from the highest file number and work downward.
- **Target condition:** Choose a chronic condition (e.g., Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 2 diabetes, endometriosis). After downloading, filter records by your condition using MeSH terms, title keywords, or abstract text.
- **Data to extract per record:** Abstracts, titles, authors, affiliations, publication dates, journal information, MeSH terms, grant numbers
- **Volume:** Download enough baseline files to yield **2,000–5,000 abstracts** for your chosen condition after filtering. Since each file contains ~30,000 records across all of biomedicine, you will likely need several files depending on how common your condition is in the literature.
- **Requirements:**
  - Download `.xml.gz` files from the FTP baseline and verify integrity using the accompanying `.md5` checksums
  - Decompress and parse the XML (each file conforms to the PubMed DTD — see https://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/ncbi/pubmed/doc/out/250101/)
  - Filter for records relevant to your chosen condition
  - Store raw + parsed data in PostgreSQL (justify your schema design)
  - Handle download failures and malformed XML gracefully
  - Design the pipeline so that additional baseline files can be ingested incrementally without reprocessing already-loaded files

### 3. Analytics & Evidence Extraction

This is where your analytical thinking matters most. Build downstream Dagster assets that transform PubMed abstracts and metadata into structured evidence insights. Implement **at least three** of the following analytics, choosing **at least one from each of the two categories** (LLM-Powered and Metadata-Powered):

#### LLM-Powered Analytics (extraction from abstract text)

These require using an LLM to extract structured information from unstructured abstract text.

- **Treatment-Outcome Extraction:** Extract mentioned treatments and their reported outcomes/efficacy direction from each abstract. Build a treatment-outcome matrix showing which treatments are associated with which outcomes, ranked by frequency and effect direction.
- **Study Design Classification:** Classify each abstract by study design — randomized controlled trial, cohort study, case-control, meta-analysis, case report, narrative review, etc. Analyze how the distribution of study designs for your condition has evolved over time.
- **Patient Population Profiling:** Extract the patient populations described in abstracts — demographics (age, sex), disease severity or stage, and key inclusion/exclusion criteria. Aggregate to surface which populations are well-studied and which are under-represented.
- **Evidence Synthesis Summaries:** For the top-N most frequently mentioned treatments, generate a concise evidence summary across all relevant abstracts — what the weight of evidence suggests, with caveats.

#### Metadata-Powered Analytics (structured PubMed fields)

These leverage the rich structured metadata PubMed provides without requiring LLM extraction.

- **Publication Trend Analysis:** Track publication volume per year for the condition. Identify inflection points (sudden increases/decreases) and correlate them with known events — major drug approvals, guideline changes, or public health developments.
- **MeSH Term Co-occurrence Network:** Build a co-occurrence matrix of MeSH descriptors assigned to the retrieved abstracts. Cluster the network to reveal the subtopic structure of research for your condition. Identify the densest clusters and the most bridging terms.
- **Research Geography:** Map author affiliations to countries or institutions. Identify where research on this condition is concentrated and how geographic distribution has shifted over time.
- **Funding Landscape:** Extract grant information from PubMed's structured grant fields. Identify the major funding agencies, how funding focus has shifted, and whether funding correlates with publication volume.

#### Combined Analytics (LLM + metadata)

These combine LLM-extracted information with PubMed metadata for deeper insights.

- **Treatment Paradigm Shifts:** Overlay LLM-extracted treatment mentions onto the publication timeline to track how the research focus has evolved — which treatments dominated each era, and when new therapies emerged.
- **Evidence Gap Detection:** Cross-reference MeSH terms with LLM-extracted study characteristics to surface areas that lack high-quality evidence. For example, a treatment with many case reports but no RCTs, or a patient subpopulation with limited research coverage.

**For each analytic you implement:**
- Write it as a Dagster asset with proper metadata
- Document your assumptions and known limitations
- Store results in a queryable format

**Approach to extraction:** Your analytics pipeline must use an **LLM** for at least the entity extraction and/or classification steps (e.g., identifying treatments, outcomes, study designs from abstract text). Use `litellm` as the LLM interface and Gemini as the model — you can generate a free API key from **Google AI Studio**: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey

We want to see how you design prompts for structured extraction from biomedical text. Abstracts are more formal than social media posts, but they are dense, use domain-specific terminology, and often describe multiple treatments or outcomes in a single sentence. Document your prompt design decisions and any iteration you went through. We are not expecting clinical-grade accuracy; we are evaluating your ability to craft effective prompts, handle LLM output reliably, and acknowledge limitations honestly.

---

## What We're Looking For

- **Reproducibility:** `docker compose up` works. No hidden setup steps, no missing environment variables.
- **Clean Python Code:** Well-organized, typed, readable. Pydantic models for data schemas. Docstrings where they matter.
- **Dagster Proficiency:** Proper use of assets, resources, and metadata. The pipeline should tell a clear story in the Dagster UI.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Thoughtful prompts that produce consistent, structured output from dense biomedical text. We want to see how you handle domain terminology, enforce output schemas, and iterate on prompt design.
- **Analytical Substance:** The analytics should produce insights a biomedical researcher or healthcare analyst would find genuinely useful — not just word counts.
- **Testing:** Tests that verify meaningful behavior.

## Deliverables

Submit a link to a **private GitHub repository** and send an invite to **johannes.unruh@mamahealth.io** (`tj-mm`) and **lorenzo.famiglini@mamahealth.io** (`lollomamahealth`).

The repository must contain:

1. **`docker-compose.yml`** — Starts the full stack
2. **`pyproject.toml`** + **`uv.lock`** — All dependencies, fully reproducible
3. **`src/`** — Pipeline code with clear module organization
4. **`tests/`** — Unit tests for ingestion logic, extraction utilities, and at least one analytics asset
5. **`README.md`** with:
   - **Setup instructions** — From clone to running pipeline
   - **Architecture overview** — How assets relate, what each does
   - **Condition choice** — Why you picked what you picked, how you filtered the bulk data, and how many baseline files you needed
   - **Prompt design decisions** — How you structured your LLM prompts for biomedical text extraction and why
   - **Analytics design decisions** — What you implemented and what the limitations are
   - **Example output** — Screenshots of Dagster materialization or sample query results

---

## Optional "Go the Extra Mile" Tasks

These are **completely optional** but will distinguish strong candidates:

- **Dagster Partitions:** Implement partitions over the baseline files (e.g., one partition per `.xml.gz` file) so the pipeline naturally supports incremental ingestion and selective re-processing.
- **Data Quality Checks:** Add Dagster asset checks or freshness policies that alert when data looks anomalous (e.g., unexpected drop in abstract volume, LLM extraction failure rates, malformed XML responses).
- **Visualization Layer:** Include a simple dashboard (Streamlit, Plotly Dash, or even static HTML) that renders your analytics outputs — treatment-outcome heatmaps, MeSH co-occurrence networks, publication trend charts, research geography maps.
- **Knowledge Graph:** Store extracted treatment-outcome-population triples in a lightweight knowledge graph (e.g., NetworkX or SQLite with a graph schema) to enable queries like "what outcomes are reported for treatment X in population Y."
- **Abstract Embeddings:** Compute embeddings for abstracts and use clustering (e.g., UMAP + HDBSCAN) to discover research subtopics beyond what MeSH terms capture.
- **CI Pipeline:** Add a GitHub Actions workflow that runs linting (`ruff`), type checking (`mypy`), and tests on push.

## Time Expectation

We respect your time. This challenge is designed to be completed in **6–8 hours**. Focus on a clean, working pipeline with a few well-implemented analytics rather than trying to cover everything superficially. A smaller scope done well is better than a broad scope done poorly.
